This repository is currently in development.

It stands to contain the work on a browser extension (currently only supporting Chromium), that will restrict browsers from downloading any files (or from any online sources) except those that are whitelisted from a proprietary certificate-authority, whereby the files are validated for cryptographic integrity and non-repudiation to the result of guaranteed and secure intra-organizational file transfer.
